So, I won't go through the theory behind it but, in a nutshell, it is an analysis that at last, tells us sentences like these:\n\n- \"If *this* then *that*\" \n- \"People who did *that* also did *that*\" \n- \"People who watched *that* also watched *that*\" \n- \"People who bought *that* also bought *that*\" \n\nOne of the greatest stories in data science is the legend beer-and-diapers story. The legend says that (Full story [here](https://canworksmart.com/diapers-beer-retail-predictive-analytics/#:~:text=The%20legend%20says%20that%20a,have%20beer%20in%20their%20carts).):\n\n> A study was done by a retail grocery store. The findings were that men between 30-40 years in age, shopping between 5 pm and 7 pm on Fridays, who purchased **diapers** were most likely to also have **beer** in their carts.\n\nBesides the fact that why and how buying diapers and beers should be correlated, this sentence is exactly what kind of information we can extract from the apriori algorithm or in a wider and broader terminology, association rules.\n\nAs I mentioned, I won't go through the theory behind this algorithm but, there're three terminologies needed to be discussed:\n\n1. Support \n2. Confidence\n3. Lift\n\nConsider a Market Basket Optimization problem. Support in such a problem gives us an idea of how frequent a product or an item is in all the transactions. It has the following formula for product $1$ ($P1$):\n\n> $$Support(P1) = \\frac{\\text{# of transactions containing P1}}{\\text{Total # of transactions}}$$\n\nIn the same kind of problem, Confidence defines as how likely a product or an item is in the transaction given that the transaction already has a second product (or products). It has the following formula for product $1$ ($P1$) and product $2$ ($P2$):\n\n> $$Confidence(P1->P2) = \\frac{\\text{# of transactions containing P1 and P2}}{\\text{# of transactions containing P1}}$$\n\nSo in a simpler form, it says how often $P2$ appears in transactions that contain $P1$ only.\n\n\nFinally, lift tells us how likely $P2$ is purchased when $P1$ is purchased. In another term, how much our confidence is lifted that $P2$ will be purchased given that $P1$ is already purchased. It has the following formula:\n\n> $$Lift(P1) = \\frac{Confidence(P1->P2)}{Support(P1)}$$\n\nA lift value above $1$ means that $P2$ is likely to be bought if $P1$ is bought. Usually, a good value for lift is above $2$. Yet, I didn't use the same procedure for this problem in this notebook, and I only took a look at the supports.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To implement the apriori algorithm in Python, I've seen people using the *mlxtend* library in Kaggle but, I found the *Apyori* library a better option since it provides the confidence and the lift values as well. **Moreover, in association rules mining, the left-hand side (lhs) and right-hand side (rhs) of the rules are not interchangeable.
